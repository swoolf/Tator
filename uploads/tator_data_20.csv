[00:00:00.00] Sophia: ...so that it was double., 
"[00:00:15.11] Sophia: Why don't we like, take four of these things and", 
"[00:00:18.15] Cecelia: Wait wait, let's wait until they give us more materials and we'll see what there is.", 
"[00:00:31.20] Sophia: Ooo, this might...coffee filters.", 
[00:00:38.25] Cecelia: Balloons! Oh my gosh., 
"[00:00:41.16] Ruth: Balloons, I want a balloon.", 
[00:00:46.11] Cecelia: What if we blow them up and tie it?, 
"[00:00:47.20] Sophia: What if we put, like, some paper clips or something in here.", 
[00:00:50.11] Cecelia: What if we blew it up and tied it?, 
[00:00:53.23] Sophia: Yeah but that would go out immediately., 
[00:00:56.03] Cecelia: Oh right., 
"[00:00:57.12] Sophia: We should, we just have to weight it down with something. Like, umm, scissors. Why don't we put--let's see what's like heavy enough to, oh I didn't even notice this blue paper.", 
"[00:01:10.00] Cecelia: No wait, because this isn't helium so it will just go down and the air will be pushing it up.", 
"[00:01:14.13] Sophia: Yeah I know but, I know but the air it will be so strong.", 
[00:01:19.01] Ruth: Let's look through the box of materials we have and then once we look through them we might get some ideas., 
"[00:01:28.02] Sophia: Okay, but I mean, just, there isn't that much, there's only the paper bag left.", 
"[00:01:33.28] Ruth: Umm, once we share our ideas maybe we can, umm, we can put them together to form some kind of item with all of our ideas", 
"[00:01:43.17] Cecelia: What if we, like, did this (picking up coffee filter). Poked holes through this and put the straws through it (across the coffee filter)", 
[00:01:50.27] Sophia: But I think we should use the balloon and like weight the balloon down with something., 
"[00:01:56.25] Cecelia: Oh what, somebody just tried a balloon and it looks like it actually went down and not up, see look.", 
[00:02:05.04] Sophia: But that's 'cause it not..., 
"[00:02:03.03] Chelsea: You three girls, this fan is your closest testing station so you can probably want to use that one. If there's like a long line of here and that one's empty then you can totally just go use", 
that one but..., 
"[00:02:15.20] Sophia: Okay, so I have a question, so if we, say we use a balloon and we fill it up and get that it goes down and we can't untie it, can we, and if we run out of", 
balloons can we just get new ones., 
[00:02:29.07] Chelsea: We have a few extra balloons but if it goes down then we can still get it out., 
"[00:02:33.09] Sophia: No no, if you tie it and you can't untie it...", 
"[00:02:36.29] Chelsea: Ohhhhhh...yeah, I have a couple extras. We could probably, we might be able to help you untie it too do we'll try that first.", 
"[00:02:45.11] Cecelia: Wait, so instead of using the straws I was just thinking of making like a foil with a parachute...", 
[00:02:54.24] Sophia: I'm gonna try a balloon first and see if it works 'cause--, 
[00:02:58.00] Cecelia: And I'll try this. Do you have an idea? (to Ruth) So that we can all try our own ideas and see whose works the best maybe., 
[00:03:05.02] Ruth: Umm...hold on a second..., 
"[00:03:18.15] Sophia: Wait, is it okay if I blow this up with my mouth? Is it okay? (Cecelia nods)", 
"[00:03:37.21] Ruth: Maybe we could, umm, we could take a balloon and maybe try to stuff it up with newspaper and wrap it up in tin foil to cover some of the-- well, ?? so it has to be at", 
least (pause) and it has to be heavier than ??, 
"[00:04:18.05] Sophia: Wait guys, don't tie any balloons yet okay?", 
"[00:04:31.04] ** Sophia goes to testing station, Cecelia watching--Sophia tests balloon?, MV testing", 
[00:13:12.22] * Sophia tests--without letting go, 
"[00:13:14.01] Sophia: Yeah, see look, this just goes straight up (holding on, then let's go). Oh! So cool. Oh that's so weird it's like just going straight!", 
"[00:13:20.22] Riley: So you got yours to hover but it's not hovering in the right spot. That's cool, can I see it again?", 
[00:13:29.08] * Sophia tests again, 
[00:13:31.11] Sophia: That's so weird it's like..., 
[00:13:37.25] * Sophia leaves, 
------------------------------------------, 
[00:04:49.09] * Sophia back, 
[00:04:49.10] Sophia: We just need to weight it down a little bit like with just a tiny bit of paper or something. Actually I can probably untie this, 
[00:04:56.14] Riley: So what do you guys think? Tell me what you saw happen in your first test., 
"[00:05:02.19] Sophia: Umm, well we just saw like, I mean, it was too--we just need to weight it down a little bit. Like with paper or something.", 
[00:05:09.20] Riley: So why did you decide to untie your balloon?, 
"[00:05:12.28] Sophia: So that we can, so that we can reuse it.", 
[00:05:15.24] Riley: Are you going to blow it up to the same size?, 
[00:05:17.29] Sophia: Yeah. So that we could put paper., 
"[00:05:20.06] Riley Oh, you're going to weigh it down on the inside of the balloon? Okay cool.", 
[00:05:25.29] Ruth: I am so bad a blowing up balloons., 
[00:05:33.02] Cecelia: You want me to see what this does? (the coffee filter) I want to see what this does., 
[00:05:36.06] Sophia: Yes please, 
[00:05:36.14] ** Cecelia goes to testing station with coffee filter, 
[00:14:27.00] * Cecelia tests coffee filter, 
[00:14:29.08] Cecelia: It does the same thing as the balloon ??, 
[00:14:34.02] * leaves, 
[00:05:44.10] * Cecelia back, 
[00:05:44.27] Cecelia: It just does the same thing as the balloon except even higher., 
[00:05:49.07] Sophia: I'm just going to fold this up really tiny. (foil), 
[00:05:55.29] Cecelia: Here what if we ball it up (the coffee filter) or tape it and see what happens there., 
"[00:06:00.23] * Ruth blowing up & tying white balloon, Sophia adding to her balloon, Cecelia taping up coffee filter", 
[00:06:22.24] Cecelia: I don't think this will work because it's going to be too small, 
[00:06:29.11] Sophia?: Let's see if this works, 
[00:06:29.23] * Ruth's balloon flies away while trying to tie it, 
[00:06:31.25] ** Sophia goes to test? (maybe can't because Lija starts talking)--Cecelia follows soon, 
"[00:06:35.29] Lija: So, engineers, I just want to point out that some people are going up and just taking just one material and testing the tube, that is awesome. Just to see how a material works can actually help you", 
"a lot if you design whatever it is you're designing to cover. So if you want to see how a piece of paper floats or a ballon or anything, test it out. Don't hesistate to jump up there and go.", 
, 
"[00:06:58.05] Cecelia: Let's cut this in half (small magazine), I just have a feeling it's going to-", 
"[00:07:11.06] Sophia: look at that, it's funny. Oh look, look, that's so funny the orange is right under the bars and the other one is right over.", 
"[00:07:28.06] Ruth: Hold on a second. Somebody blow up a bigger balloon than this and then we'll see which one is heavier, the bigger or smaller one.", 
[00:07:37.14] Cecelia: What?, 
"[00:07:38.24] Ruth: Um, somebody blow up a bigger balloon than this and we'll see which one is heavier the bigger or the smaller", 
"[00:07:42.02] Sophia: Yeah, I'm just weighing down this balloon on the inside.", 
[00:07:47.05] ** Cecelia goes to test **********************************, 
[00:16:38.15] * Cecelia tests magazine--drops, 
[00:07:47.10] Ruth: I have no I have never tied a balloon in my life and it's so hard, 
[00:07:53.00] * Cecelia back, 
[00:07:53.09] Cecelia: This is too heavy! (half the magazine), 
[00:08:01.03] * all watching M&V test, 
"[00:08:06.13] Sophia: Alright, so, this is going to take a long time for me to clean out this", 
[00:08:11.11] Cecelia: What's in here?, 
[00:08:12.08] Sophia: Paper, 
[00:08:21.12] Cecelia: you like ball it up like this., 
"[00:08:24.03] Sophia: I know, I know it just takes a long time to actually", 
[00:08:32.24] Sophia: Where are the other balloons?, 
[00:08:42.29] Sophia: I'm just gonna blow it up like this, 
[00:08:49.29] Cecelia: Yeah that's good. Blow it up like that., 
[00:08:50.21] Ruth: Finally! I learned how to tie a balloon it took about 10 minutes, 
[00:08:58.24] Cecelia: You want to try that? (reaching for Ruth's balloon), 
"[00:08:59.15] Ruth: Blow a big balloon and we'll see which one is heavier. And then when we test it out, whichever one is heavier we might be able to tie it to, we might tie it to, like, the first", 
"one, (losing Cecelia's attention) someone blow up a bigger balloon so then we'll see which one is heavier, the bigger one or the smaller one.", 
"[00:09:24.25] Cecelia: Is there paper in this? (to Sophia, while she's blowing up the blue balloon)", 
"[00:09:32.13] Sophia: Ooo there's a paper ball. Put it in, quickly!", 
[00:09:35.21] Ruth: I hate balloons., 
"[00:09:37.15] Sophia: No it has to be smaller, like put that one, the little tiny one in there. Just drop it in. Drop it in quick, quick, quick, quick! Okay now drop another one in. Perfect. That's a good plan", 
to just open it up really wide., 
[00:10:01.05] Cecelia: (to Ruth) Want me to try this (white balloon) and see if it floats higher than the big balloon?, 
"[00:10:04.19] Ruth: I want to see which one's heavier, the bigger or the smaller one.", 
"[00:10:05.19] ** Cecelia goes to test with Ruth's white balloon, Ruth follows", 
"[00:18:56.14] * Cecelia tests white balloon- hovers, then flies up", 
"[00:10:13.28] Riley: So Sophia, how do you know how big to blow it up?", 
"[00:10:18.16] Sophia: Umm, I usually blow it up to about the same size.", 
[00:10:25.24] * Sophia also at testing station??-- Cecelia & Ruth waiting for M&V, 
[00:10:39.05] * Cecelia tests white balloon-flies out top **********************************, 
[00:19:27.19] * Cecelia tests white balloon again-- flies up, 
[00:19:39.22] * Sophia there trying to tie balloon, 
"[00:10:42.28] * Cecelia back, drops off balloon, back to testing station", 
[00:10:42.17] Cecelia: OK try the one with the paper (to Sophia?), 
(M&V testing), 
[00:11:35.12] * Abby testing? MV testing again--up to 12 seconds, 
"[00:11:55.16] * Ruth back to table, grabs white balloon (already had blue balloon), leaves again", 
[00:20:44.22] * Sophia tests (Cecelia there too)--hovers above tube, 
[00:20:48.03] Riley: Still cool right? Pretty mesmerizing., 
[00:20:50.16] * Sophia & Cecelia leave, 
[00:12:02.00] ** Sophia tests her balloon?, 
[00:12:04.12] * Sophia & Cecelia back to table, 
[00:12:05.28] Sophia: ?? paper, 
"[00:12:07.01] Cecelia: What about stuff that's like, this (lollipop sticks). Like paper clips.", 
"[00:12:12.21] Sophia: I like paper, I think paper will be good. Actually yeah paper clips would be good too.", 
"[00:12:22.06] Cecelia: The only thing is, will they pop the balloon?", 
"[00:12:25.28] Sophia: Yeah, they might", 
[00:12:29.27] Cecelia: What about--you saw what they did. You want to try-, 
"[00:12:32.13] Sophia: Yeah, but it didn't work that well though.", 
[00:12:35.27] Cecelia: Yeah, 
[00:20:52.28] * Ruth tests blue balloon--too light-- hovers above tube, 
[00:20:55.05] Ruth: ??, 
"[00:20:58.18] Adult: It's really cool, huh. How about what if you put this one underneath it? (white one--both fly away)", 
[00:21:10.27] * Ruth tests just white one--still too light, 
"[00:21:14.17] Ruth: OK, now I know ??", 
[00:21:46.10] * Ruth leaves, 
[00:12:58.21] * Ruth back--was she testing?- yes, 
"[00:13:06.20] Cecelia: Ooo, can I wrap the balloon up in this? (tin foil-white balloon-- so asking Ruth?)", 
[00:13:10.26] Sophia: It might work., 
[00:13:14.28] Cecelia: It's too small. (begins blowing up another balloon), 
"[00:13:42.18] Sophia: Wait, wait. Cecelia I'm going to open this up, would you, I'm going to open this up. Would you just drop these bits of paper in please.", 
[00:13:58.03] Cecelia: I hate tying balloons., 
"(Chelsea fixes camera, talking about camera)", 
"[00:14:16.17] Cecelia: Would you tie this balloon for me, I can never tie balloons.", 
[00:14:18.23] Chelsea: Absolutely. They're tough (shows how tie), 
"[00:14:24.05] Sophia: Just, no no no, just one piece at a time.", 
[00:14:27.23] Chelsea: So you're putting paper in the balloon., 
[00:14:30.16] Sophia: Paper to weigh it down with, 
[00:14:32.22] Chelsea: And then do you blow it up or do you do it just like that., 
[00:14:34.08] Sophia: Then we blow it up., 
[00:14:35.12] Chelsea: Interesting, 
"[00:14:36.11] Sophia: Wait, a little bit more please.", 
[00:14:39.22] Cecelia: One more?, 
"[00:14:41.27] Sophia: Yeah (pause, adjusting balloon) Hey look, this is totally filled.", 
[00:15:09.27] * Cecelia wrapping blue balloon in foil, 
[00:15:27.27] Cecelia: Should I try this? Like put it in the foil? I'm gonna try this., 
[00:15:34.13] ** Cecelia goes to test-- not sure if she's allowed before Lija talks, 
[00:24:24.04] * Cecelia tests balloon wrapped in foil-- a bit low--then falls, 
[00:24:43.12] * Cecelia leaves, 
[00:24:44.23] * Sophia comes to test--Riley tells to go back (Lija talking), 
#NAME?, 
"[00:15:56.23] Lija: So we're noticing awesome, awesome ideas and we're interested in knowing about what you're thinking before you test. So we've got two cameras on the testing station and we're hoping, if you feel comfortable, if you could say", 
"quickly what it is that you hope to see happen. Okay, and if you make a change if you could say why you made that change. And Kerrianne and Riley and Chelsea and I will kind of prompt you so", 
don't worry about it we'll help you with that piece. We'd like to get at your thinking and we want to be noticing your thinking as well. So you can see how it can help you design something. The second, 
things i we do have water here and cups and we want to make sure that you're hydrating yourselves..., 
[00:15:43.01] * Ruth starts wrapping her blue balloon in foil too, 
[00:15:54.13] * Cecelia back from test, 
[00:15:55.26] * Sophia goes to test--right back (not allowed b/c Lija talking),

[00:25:46.12] * Sophia there to test-- Riley turns on, 
[00:25:59.21] * Sophia tests blue balloon-- hovers right at top of tube, 
"[00:26:01.14] Sophia: Ugh, a little bit more weights.", 
"[00:26:09.11] Riley: Alright, what are you going to do this time?", 
"[00:26:11.10] Sophia: Umm, put more weights inside and paper inside so I'm going to try and make it even heavier.", 
[00:26:19.14] * Sophia leaves, 
[00:17:08.14] Cecelia: ?? (To Ruth), 
[00:17:10.03] Ruth: Yes, 
[00:17:15.26] Ruth: ?? (laying out tape), 
[00:17:32.08] * Sophia back, 
[00:17:32.04] Cecelia: That work?, 
[00:17:33.12] Sophia: A little bit more., 
[00:18:06.18] Ruth: Way too light (referring to M&V's test), 
"[00:18:13.03] * Ruth & Cecelia taping foil onto their balloons, Sophia lets air out of her balloon again", 
"[00:18:23.29] Sophia: Okay, so, here are little bits of paper for you. Would you just put a few, little bit more in? Please?", 
[00:18:32.01] Cecelia: Yeah. Let me just tape this up., 
[00:18:35.01] Sophia: It's weird cuz now we're all working on our different ideas and and last time we were all working on..., 
"[00:18:40.17] Cecelia: Yeah but once one is, like, really close, well me and Ruth are sort of doing the same thing (pause) alright, let' s see.", 
[00:19:10.13] *adding paper to Sophia balloon, 
[00:19:11.18] Cecelia: There's not much room left in this., 
"[00:19:14.04] Sophia: Oops, sorry.", 
[00:19:14.15] Cecelia: A little more?, 
"[00:19:15.20] Sophia: Yeah. Like three more....two, one more. Actually one more after this. Thank you. Thank you.", 
[00:19:46.02] Lija: Hello ladies. Foil covered ballons? What's the thinking behind that?, 
[00:19:47.25] Cecelia: We thought it might make it a little bit heavier., 
"[00:19:50.07] Ruth: I tested which one was heavier so I tested the white one and the blue one and, then I, tested this one (white) and it went higher so I knew this one was heavier", 
[00:20:04.03] Lija: So you're trying to find something in between those two things. So why do you think weight is even important in this activity?, 
"[00:20:08.02] Cecelia: Because if it's too light it'll just like, make it go (motioning upwards), it'll like the wind will just push it very easily", 
"[00:20:08.02] Cecelia: Because if it's too light it'll just like, make it go (motioning upwards), it'll like the wind will just push it very easily", 
[00:20:17.10] Lija: It'll fly out, 
"[00:20:16.15] Ruth: Too light too high, too heavy too low.", 
[00:20:18.06] Lija: I love how you put that. ??, 
[00:20:24.03] Ruth: ?? when it comes to like, 
[00:20:28.17] Lija: ??,

"[00:29:26.14] Riley: Okay, so, before you put it in. What are you expecting to happen?", 
"[00:29:31.28] Cecelia: Well, I think it still might be a little high but I'm just going to see, like.", 
"[00:29:37.18] Riley: Okay, so what happened last time.", 
"[00:29:39.27] Cecelia: Umm, it went like (motions flying out the top)", 
"[00:29:42.15] Riley: It flew out. Okay good, so check it out.", 
[00:29:46.20] * Cecelia tests foil covered balloon--drops, 
[00:29:48.10] Cecelia: (quietly) It's too heavy., 
"[00:29:51.08] Riley: OK, so it sunk down. Why do you think it sunk to the bottom?", 
[00:29:57.08] Cecelia: It might have been too heavy., 
"[00:29:58.24] Riley: Okay, so, what do you think you're going to do to change it?", 
[00:30:05.01] Cecelia: I might. (pause) I dunno.,

[00:30:12.06] Sophia: That it'll be exactly in between the two lines., 
[00:30:15.04] Riley: So what did you do to change it from last time?, 
[00:30:17.21] Sophia: I put more paper in it., 
"[00:30:21.00] Riley: OK, let's see it", 
[00:30:22.22] * Sophia tests--hovers above tube, 
"[00:30:23.11] Riley: Is it lower, or the same?", 
[00:30:25.25] Sophia: It's about the same as it was last time a little lower., 
[00:30:31.13] Riley: So a litte bit lower than last time but still not low enough., 
[00:30:34.24] Sophia: Yeah., 
"[00:30:36.05] Riley: Okay, and what are you going to do now?",

glue. Quickly slap some magazines on there., 
"-Sophia makes a ""I don't want to"" face.", 
[00:19:42.11] Lija: Just so you can at least have a visual while you explain. Okay?, 
[00:19:45.21] Sophia: Okay., 
[00:19:48.10] Lija: Thank you Sarah is ready, 
Final share out (on testing camera), 
"[00:14:18.22] Sophia: So, my...", 
[00:14:22.24] Lija: I'm going to have you wait until everybody's ready to listen. Guys remember one of our rules that you want to respect others the way you want to be respected. So if you want other people to listen, 
give your ears to other people., 
"[00:14:36.18] Sophia: Okay, so mine popped, the actual thing, so this is just a baby one. So I had, I taped bits of magazines on the edge of it and also put magazines inside it so it would have...umm, and", 
yeah., 
[00:14:56.21] Lija: And What was your result?, 
[00:14:58.21] Sophia: It worked. But it sort of went down then came up again and then it worked., 
"[00:15:04.05] Lija: Cool, alright, thank you Sofia.", 
"[00:15:06.23] Cecelia: Okay and mine I just started with the coffee filter and the umm, pipe cleaner and then I added on popsicle sticks and then tin foil and then this (points to pops sticks on top)", 
[00:15:32.20] Riley: Do another go. It was still warming up., 
"[00:15:54.20] Lija: So Cecelia, do you remember the position of it the one time we saw it work? Okay.", 
"[00:16:02.13] Cecelia: Here, I'll try it like this.", 
[00:16:10.26] Cecelia: It only works when you put it like that., 
[00:16:15.25] Lija: There we go., 
"[00:16:20.28] Lija: So, no fear, if when you get up here it doesn't do what it did when we felt it was successful we do have it on videotape so we know that it was successful the first time. There,", 
"oh look it's getting some life there. Okay, awesome. Thank you Cecelia. Alright, Nicky's group.",

[00:00:18.15] Sarah: Not this, 
[00:00:20.22] Abby: ?? piece, 
"[00:00:22.27] Sarah: Yeah, paper", 
"[00:00:23.06] Sarah: But we're getting, we're getting, um, tin foil", 
[00:00:28.18] Abby: And balloons, 
[00:00:31.15] Sarah: Balloons? Cool I wanna blow one up, 
"[00:00:36.23] Abby: You don't want to blow it up too big, though", 
[00:00:43.24] Kerrianne: Here you go (delivers box), 
[00:00:51.06] Sarah: Yeah those are coffee (filters). Well let's see what the balloon, 
"[00:01:02.05] * Sarah starts blowing up balloon, Abby follows", 
[00:01:07.00] Abby: I can't blow them up, 
[00:01:20.15] Abby: I can't blow up balloons (to Kerrianne), 
[00:01:22.19] Kerrianne: What are you gonna use this for? Did you think of like a design yet? Or are you just kinda like blowing up balloons?, 
"[00:01:31.16] * No answer, Sarah still blowing", 
[00:01:42.22] Kerrianne: Do you guys wanna test a little bit?, 
"[00:01:44.11] Abby: Yeah, we're gonna use this (the coffee filter)", 
[00:01:46.02] * Sarah letting air out of balloon comically, 
[00:02:01.14] Kerrianne: What are you doin? Do you have an idea?, 
[00:02:05.18] Sarah: Yeah, 
[00:02:08.18] Kerrianne: I'm sure you're thinking about something, 
[00:02:08.05] Sarah: We're definitely using this (balloon?), 
[00:02:11.14] Abby: I wanna use pipe cleaners too, 
[00:02:14.09] Sarah: There's metal inside so that might be a detriment, 
[00:02:22.14] Abby: We're not using balloons. I don't want to use balloons, 
"[00:02:27.25] Sarah: I'm not going to, I just like the sound", 
"[00:02:34.23] * Abby getting out foil, Sarah letting air out of balloon", 
[00:02:42.00] Abby: Let's start working, 
[00:02:57.03] Abby: Do we have glue or something or is it only tape? Where's our tape?, 
[00:03:05.22] Sarah: How about we do this., 
[00:03:11.14] Abby: I need two big rubber bands, 
[00:03:23.05] Sarah: How about we do this (not sure what she has--paper?) and then put tin foil on it, 
[00:03:27.16] Abby: I wanna take tin foil and put it around it, 
"[00:03:29.14] Sarah: Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean. Like around the edges right here", 
[00:03:35.02] Abby: Yeah, 
[00:03:36.03] Sarah: Yeah we can do that too, 
"[00:03:37.17] Abby: And then, for the rubber bands", 
"[00:03:39.20] Sarah: And, um, and it, can we make it look like a space ship?", 
"[00:03:53.16] Abby: If we put one of these (can't see) look in here, what's in here Sarah?", 
[00:04:01.08] Sarah: Oh one of these? (picking up a straw) Oh but that weighs a lot, 
"[00:04:04.14] Abby: No if we put this, we make sure it here, then we attach. You already did this? Then we attach it like this and then have like a little thing ?? on it", 
[00:04:22.09] Sarah: Can we make it look like a UFO?, 
[00:04:25.16] Abby: That's what we're doing, 
"[00:04:41.19] Abby: Do you wanna use, like do this, so it's aerodynamic (2 coffee filters together)", 
[00:04:45.08] * Sarah lets air out of balloon again, 
[00:04:49.11] Sarah: Well. (plays with coffee filter), 
* watching others test balloons, 
[00:05:02.05] Sarah: The balloon doesn't (other girls' balloon didn't work), 
[00:05:16.04] Abby: So do you wanna like cover this (coffee filters) with tin foil on the inside?, 
"[00:05:19.10] Sarah: Yeah, cover it with tin foil and then make it look like a space ship", 
"[00:05:24.20] Abby: No, 'cause we're using", 
[00:05:26.23] Sarah: Yeah, 
[00:05:28.11] Abby: 'Cause then it will just have an aerodynamic figure, 
[00:05:30.16] Sarah: Maybe we can put a balloon inside, 
[00:05:34.19] Abby: How are we gonna attach it?, 
[00:05:37.07] Sarah: We could tape it, 
"[00:05:39.13] Abby: I don't really wanna use a balloon, everyone else is using a balloon", 
[00:05:43.20] Sarah: Please? Can we at least try?, 
"[00:05:54.21] * Sarah blowing up balloon, Abby putting together coffee filters and straws", 
[00:05:57.14] Abby: Can you get that straw? (it fell), 
[00:06:15.08] Abby: So what if we did it this way because it ??, 
[00:06:18.08] Sarah: How about and then we can put the balloon inside, 
[00:06:22.01] Abby: Look (tossing the coffee filter into the air), 
"[00:06:25.14] Sarah: Yeah but, we can put the balloon inside (pauses to blow up balloon again) and then put that on top (the other coffee filter) and then tape it and then put tin foil all over it", 
[00:06:42.18] Abby: OK, 
[00:06:43.19] Sarah: Wanna try that?, 
[00:06:43.19] Abby: Sure. We have to use some ?? around. That's a little small, 
"[00:06:52.13] Lija: So, engineers (testing just materials--good)", 
[00:07:12.00] Sarah: Is this good? (the level of inflation of the balloon, 
"[00:07:15.04] Lija: So Abby and Sarah, don't be afraid to just jump up there and test it out, you don't have to have it totally ready to go before you test it, OK?", 
[00:07:40.24] Sarah: Can we take home the balloons?, 
[00:07:43.18] Lija: Sure at the end of the day? Yeah, 
"[00:07:48.03] Lija: So girls don't be afraid to jump up and test anything. Test the filter, test the balloon", 
[00:07:51.00] Abby: I wanna just test the filter!, 
[00:07:52.16] Lija: Go test it! Go together and see what happens, 
[00:07:58.07] * Go test just filter (both) (16:51 on test N 1)*************************************************, 
[00:16:34.22] * Sarah tests-- out top?, 
[00:16:35.12] Abby: Yeah we need something to add weight onto it...we need something..., 
[00:08:11.19] Abby: ? Too light. And the balloon is too light, 
"[00:08:13.29] Sarah: That's why, you wanna try tin foil?", 
"[00:08:18.27] Abby: We need something heavy, we need like popsicle sticks", 
"[00:08:18.02] Sarah: Yeah but we can add popsicle sticks. But, can we try tin foil? Just to see", 
[00:08:29.02] * Go test just foil (17:05 on test N 1) ********************************************, 
"[00:17:05.04] * Sarah & Abby come, Sarah tests foil--flies out", 
"[00:08:35.03] Lija: Just test it, figure out what works. Play around with it, add things to it, you know", 
[00:08:41.26] Abby: What if we did this. (unfolding foil), 
"[00:08:48.16] Sarah: Abby Abby, this is my idea. wrap the balloon in this using ?? put the balloon inside the filter", 
[00:09:03.20] Abby: My grandma actually showed me how to make a goblet. We could try to do that, 
[00:09:07.19] Sarah: What's a goblet?, 
[00:09:09.24] * Abby starts folding foil, 
[00:09:13.01] Sarah: I think we should make a smaller balloon. I'm gonna make a smaller balloon., 
[00:09:17.05] Abby: Here's a purple one, 
[00:09:18.16] Sarah: Did you put your mouth on it?, 
[00:09:21.00] Abby: Maybe, 
[00:09:23.23] Sarah: I don't care, 
[00:09:56.18] * Sarah ties off purple balloon, 
[00:10:02.14] Abby: Like this (showing off goblet), 
[00:10:05.06] Sarah: Go try it out, 
[00:10:12.13] Abby: No we need to put the balloon in here. (tries with bigger balloon) it needs to be a lot smaller. Can you put this in here? (asking about purple balloon) And then we'll put the filter around it, 
, 
[00:10:33.00] Sarah: (takes filter and balloon) well this is kind of, 
[00:10:44.09] Abby: Try it. Try it back there, 
"[00:10:48.15] Sarah: No, it's a little too much (too small for balloon?) It's not wide enough", 
[00:10:53.28] Abby: Hey you just ripped it now. See but this one ?? (shows that pink balloon is too big?), 
[00:11:04.17] Sarah: Make a new one, 
[00:11:05.27] Abby: No I just want to (goes to testing in the back), 
[00:11:43.16] * Abby testing just goblet at S testing station ********************************************, 
"[00:09:53.25] * Abby there to test-- goblet--hovers, then flies out", 
[00:11:35.07] * Sarah playing, 
[00:12:14.08] Sarah: Can you just make another one?, 
[00:12:23.00] Abby: That's bigger? Or, 
[00:12:25.03] Sarah: Yeah. A little wider, 
[00:12:37.01] Sarah: Take your time. I still think we should do the flying saucer, 
[00:13:07.08] Chelsea: Abby and Sarah have you tried something yet?, 
[00:13:08.06] Abby: Yeah, 
"[00:13:08.06] Chelsea: Yeah, what have you tried? that one? How'd it work?", 
"[00:13:13.20] Abby: My grandma taught me how to make it it's like a goblet. So, um, Lija said that I was putting it in this way and I should put it in this way", 
"[00:13:21.06] Chelsea: And that, did that work better?", 
"[00:13:24.01] Abby: A little bit. So, we're making a wider one so we can fit", 
"[00:13:28.11] Chelsea: OK, cool. I like it", 
[00:13:59.09] Abby: So we have to put it in this way though (upside down), 
[00:14:02.09] Abby: Then make it smaller (talking about balloon). Just let some air out of there, 
[00:14:05.20] Sarah: Oh I have an idea (twisting balloon into goblet), 
"[00:14:16.25] * Abby gets another balloon, starts trying to blow it up", 
[00:14:34.26] Abby: I cannot blow up balloons, 
[00:14:38.04] * Sarah gets another balloon to blow up, 
"[00:14:41.08] Abby: Woah, smaller, smaller, smaller smaller (Sarah letting air out). Does it fit in? Now it fits in. Little more--stop", 
[00:15:07.15] * Sarah tying off new balloon, 
"[00:15:15.06] Abby: Can you blow it up so it fits. Oh that fits, yeah. It fits, I can make this wider", 
[00:15:31.20] Abby: This (purple one) could fit if I just make this (tries to make goblet wider), 
[00:15:50.04] Lija: (clapping) (interested in what you're thinking before you test), 
[00:17:10.25] Abby: We shouldn't have crumbled it up, 
[00:17:14.08] Sarah: OK so do you want to put random objects in it?, 
[00:17:20.26] Abby: Did you put it in this way before or this way before? (balloon orientation in goblet), 
[00:17:36.02] Sarah: It fits (other goblet with purple balloon), 
[00:17:39.16] Abby: Is that my other one?, 
[00:17:41.18] Sarah: Yeah., 
[00:17:43.24] Abby: I'm trying this one (with green balloon), 
[00:17:51.10] * Abby goes to test goblet with green balloon-- N testing station-- then comes back after seeing Vincenzo, 
[00:17:58.10] Abby: We need to add a lot more weight because it's a balloon in tin foil, 
[00:18:02.05] Abby: I'm gonna add some like popsicle sticks ?? Like this (in 'x' across open end), 
"[00:18:19.01] Sarah: Ta-da! (goblet with purple balloon, with scissors inside)", 
[00:18:42.12] * Sarah adding more foil around balloon, 
[00:18:41.18] Abby: Being a girl scout and all is actually really help doing this part (winding string around popsicle sticks), 
[00:18:53.21] Sarah: Really?, 
[00:18:56.18] Abby: It will work though, 
[00:19:36.08] * Abby taping popsicle sticks to side of goblet, 
[00:20:16.21] * Sarah taping popsicle sticks to hers too, 
[00:20:20.10] Chelsea: So what have you guys got here?, 
[00:20:22.01] Abby: Well we put a balloon in my goblet thing, 
[00:20:25.13] Chelsea: In the goblets? I like thsoe goblets, 
"[00:20:26.03] Abby: Yeah and then the balloon and tin foil sort of makes it really really light so I added a popsicle stick like, to make it like a little heavier", 
[00:20:37.14] Chelsea: Got it. Awesome. Have you tried it yet?, 
"[00:20:39.07] Abby: No, I'm going to try it right now", 
[00:20:41.11] Chelsea: OK,

"[00:20:51.02] Lija: How's it going Abby, so what are you doing here?", 
[00:20:53.04] Sarah: I'm Sarah,

[00:20:58.01] Abby: There, 
[00:20:59.03] Lija: Did it work?, 
"[00:20:59.03] Abby: No, it fell.", 
[00:21:00.06] Lija: It fell?, 
[00:21:01.06] Abby: But it does look like a helicopter, 
"[00:21:02.19] Lija: It does kind of look like one. Did you want it to act like a helicopter, though", 
"[00:21:07.03] Abby: Well I was trying to make. Cause I thought with a balloon and the tin foil made it really light, so I added popsicle sticks but that made it too heavy", 
"[00:21:15.07] Lija: Too heavy, OK. Sorry Sarah. Sarah, what's your thinking? What are you gonna do?", 
[00:21:18.25] Sarah: I used the goblet and put tin foil over it, 
[00:21:22.00] Lija: Oh so you made the tin foil goblet. And then what's inside?, 
[00:21:25.19] Sarah: A balloon, 
[00:21:25.19] Lija: A balloon. OK. And that's good for weight. OK,

"[00:30:51.15] Sarah Umm, it's a tin-foil goblet with a balloon inside and a ?? on top", 
"[00:30:58.25] Riley: OK, a tin foil goblet, balloon on the inside, small balloon--this is smaller than ??", 
[00:31:03.21] Sarah: Yeah,

[00:31:05.03] * Sarah tests-- falls, 
[00:31:04.18] Riley: Okay. Why do you think it sunk?, 
"[00:31:09.11] Sarah: Umm, probably the weight of the tin foil", 
"[00:31:12.29] Riley: The weight of the tin foil, okay.", 
[00:31:14.15] Abby: Before I had a popsicle stick on this but it made it too heavy so I'm trying it now, 
[00:31:20.18] * Abby tests-- falls, 
[00:31:22.08] Abby: and it's still too heavy., 
[00:31:21.25] Riley: Still too heavy. Okay.,

[00:22:57.28] * Abby back, 
[00:22:57.20] Abby: Still too . ?? heavy. I think it's just the balloon. I'm gonna go try it out (just the balloon-goes to leave), 
[00:23:05.24] Sarah: It doesnt work, 
[00:23:06.22] Abby: Are you sure? Oh yeah you tried this. Try the purple one,

[00:33:02.22] * Sarah tests balloon-- falls, 
[00:33:08.04] Riley: This is the first balloon I've see not float. Why do you think your balloon doesn't float?,

[00:34:22.06] Abby: To make it lighter., 
[00:34:22.22] Riley: To make it lighter. Okay. What about the coffee filter makes it lighter?,

[00:44:40.07] Lija: It's still--yeah-- but it did a bit differently when you went like this so try and figure this out. Try again because if you watch what it does maybe you can think of a new way to engineer, 
it,

"[00:45:30.21] Sarah: Umm, because it's a balloon and there's some weight on it.", 
[00:45:32.04] Lija: And there's some weight down there. So if you were to change anything and you wanted it to be right in between here what do you think you could do to make that happen?,

[00:12:19.19] Nicky: Cut off the parachute, 
[00:12:19.19] Lija: You cut off the parachute, 
"[00:12:27.03] * Nicky tests-- hovers near top, then out top", 
[00:12:32.28] Nicky: Needs more weight, 
[00:12:34.21] Regan: Mine needs much more weight, 
[00:12:36.07] * Regan tests-- still hovers above the tube, 
"[00:12:38.04] Lija: Yours needs much more weight? So your idea is if you tape things--so it really stuck here, too right", 
[00:12:42.09] Regan: Yeah, 
"[00:12:43.00] Lija: So your idea is if you taping more to the balloon, it will give you", 
[00:12:45.22] Regan: Yeah, 
[00:12:47.03] Lija: So why is that going to help you? Why is taping more ?? What's your idea, 
[00:12:51.02] Regan: Cause when there's more um weight on the balloon it will go down more, 
[00:12:55.07] Lija: Uh huh, 
"[00:12:57.19] Regan: So, it will stay about here (showing with balloon)", 
[00:12:59.05] Lija: OK, 
"[00:13:01.17] Regan: So that will, will be ??", 
"[00:13:02.09] Lija: So why do you think that will work? And when I ask questions I'm not saying your wrong, I'm just trying to understand what you're thinking. I think it could work, I'm just asking", 
[00:13:10.24] Regan: It will float in the tube but it will sometimes go up but then some of the weight will pull it back down, 
[00:13:20.05] Lija: Some of the weight will kind of pull it back down, 
"[00:13:21.09] Regan: So, yeah, so it will hover right here", 
[00:13:23.18] Lija: Nicky (calling him to get his design), 
[00:13:24.10] Nicky: Yeah?, 
[00:13:09.27] * Nicky tests-- falls bottom, 
[00:13:33.02] * Regan adds foil--balls, 
"[00:13:40.01] Regan: OK, let's try this", 
[00:13:41.09] Nicky: I've got an idea. Fill a balloon with different amounts of air., 
[00:13:46.04] Regan: What?, 
"[00:13:46.27] Nicky: Just fill a balloon with different amounts of air, more air will make it go up, less air will make it go down and if you get the correct amount of air", 
[00:13:56.08] Regan: And do you need it to go up or down?, 
"[00:13:59.13] Nicky: Um, well, sort of up", 
[00:14:00.13] Regan: What?, 
"[00:14:02.05] Nicky: Sort of up, so I'm adding more air", 
[00:14:04.20] Regan: I need it to go down, 
[00:14:06.27] Nicky: So take some air out, 
[00:14:08.15] Regan: So I'm adding more weight, 
[00:14:08.24] Nicky: Take some air out of it, 
"[00:14:13.00] Regan: I'm not gonna add air, I'm just gonna add weight", 
[00:14:25.08] * Regan taping on foil, 
[00:14:33.28] * Regan testsflies up, 
[00:14:49.13] Regan: Still too light!, 
[00:14:52.17] Nicky: Take air out of it, 
"[00:14:54.13] Regan: I'll just add more weight. It keeps going down. But I need, I just don't want to add too much weight that it stays, that it goes too much down. I want to add little bits of weight", 
a little at a time so if I do the same thing I just did it could work (adding more foil balls), 
[00:15:28.26] * Nicky trying to re-tie balloon? Or untie it?, 
[00:15:38.02] * Regan tests again--hovers at top, 
[00:15:38.21] Lija: (clapping) So we're noticing awesome awesome ideas and work and we're interested in knowing--Marco and Vincenzo--about what you're thinking before you test. So we've got two cameras on the testing stations and we're hoping if you feel comfortable, 
"if you could say, quickly, what it is that you hope to see happen. OK? And if you make a change if you could say why you made that change and Kerrianne and Riley and Chelsea and I will kind", 
"of prompt you, so don't worry about it, we'll help you with that piece, cause we'd like to get at your thinking and we want you to be noticing your thinking as well. So how, see how it can help", 
you design something. The second thing-- water, 
"[00:17:12.21] Kerrianne: Are you starting a new, a different design?", 
[00:17:15.13] Nicky: Yup. The balloon popped, 
[00:17:16.29] Kerrianne: Oh it did, 
[00:17:19.03] Nicky: So I just tried that, 
[00:17:20.29] Kerrianne: Did you get a working design with the balloon, 
[00:17:23.27] Nicky: Almost, 
[00:17:23.27] Kerrianne: Almost?, 
"[00:17:25.00] Nicky: Almost. But the balloon popped, so I'm just stuffing this (piece of egg carton) with a bit of this (bubble wrap) and hoping it works", 
[00:17:31.18] Kerrianne: A bit of--you're stuffing egg carton with a bit of, 
[00:17:38.01] Nicky: bubble wrap, 
[00:17:38.20] Kerrianne: Bubble wrap? Why do you think that will work?, 
[00:17:39.24] Nicky: I have no idea, 
[00:17:41.02] Kerrianne: You don't know?, 
[00:17:44.05] Nicky: Trying a bunch of random stuff. So put it in when he's done?, 
[00:17:47.14] Kerrianne: Yup, 
[00:17:55.02] * Nicky tests new design-- falls to bottom, 
[00:17:58.19] Nicky: OK. I need another balloon. Can I get another balloon?, 
"[00:18:01.08] Kerrianne: I don't think there are anymore. (Nicky: There's lots) Oh there are? Yeah, you can grab another one", 
[00:18:09.24] * Regan tests-- had added just more weight? still high, 
[00:18:13.10] Kerrianne: So what did you change from last time?, 
[00:18:15.01] Regan: I put more. I'm putting more pipe cleaners and tin foil on it to weigh it down more. And, 
[00:18:23.01] Alex: Still too light, 
"[00:18:23.01] Regan: It's working, but it's still too light. It used to be way up here and now it's down here", 
[00:18:24.28] Kerrianne: Oh nice. Well you know it's working then, 
[00:18:27.26] Regan: Yeah, 
[00:18:29.09] * Nicky blowing up new balloon, 
[00:18:43.27] * Nicky goes to test-- something messes up-- pipe cleaner comes off?, 
[00:18:58.29] * Regan adding pipe cleaners?, 
[00:19:28.18] Kerrianne: So did you just move the location of the sticks? or straws?, 
[00:19:32.11] Regan: I added a bunch more stuff. (has to wait for Liam), 
[00:19:34.28] Kerrianne: You did? I think Liam's been waiting (talking to Liam), 
[00:19:51.12] Regan: I added a bunch more, 
[00:19:51.20] Kerrianne: A bunch more sticks?, 
[00:19:51.00] * Regan tests again-- falls too low, 
"[00:19:53.11] Regan: 1-2, Uh, Too heavy", 
[00:19:56.01] Kerrianne: Too heavy, 
[00:19:55.27] Regan: Take a couple of those sticks off, 
[00:20:01.23] Regan: Now I added a bunch of sticks and now it's too heavy, 
[00:20:14.26] * Nicky blowing up balloon still, 
[00:20:24.05] * Regan tests, 
[00:20:26.05] Regan: And now it's too light! I just took away half the sticks. And now it's too light, 
"[00:20:35.06] * Nicky tests-- floats around top, then out--adds more air?", 
[00:20:34.22] Nicky: Too light, 
[00:20:35.20] Kerrianne: Too light, 
[00:20:40.29] Regan: Maybe a pipe cleaner here (taping on another pipe cleaner), 
[00:20:50.24] Kerrianne: What did you do that was different?, 
[00:20:52.15] Nicky: Less air. I mean more air., 
[00:20:54.12] Kerrianne: Oo! Careful (fell into fan a bit), 
"[00:20:51.15] * Nicky tests -- falls to bottom, adjusts air", 
[00:21:01.13] Chelsea: (to Nicky) What's inside your balloon? other than air, 
[00:21:04.00] Nicky: Nothing, 
[00:21:05.01] Chelsea: Nothing? It just looks distorted so I thought there was something maybe inside, 
"[00:21:16.15] * Nicky tests againworking, then goes up", 
[00:21:16.29] Nicky: Adding and then ?? in?, 
"[00:21:21.14] Chelsea: How are you so easily adding air? Oh, did you not tie it?", 
"[00:21:22.22] Nicky: Um, no, I didn't tie it as tight so I can force it out or force it in", 
"[00:21:24.28] Chelsea: Oh, OK", 
[00:21:28.11] Kerrianne: I think what it's doing is it's. I think it's losing air, 
[00:21:29.11] Nicky: No it's not, 
[00:21:29.29] Kerrianne: As--Oh no?, 
[00:21:32.18] Liam: I think it is, 
[00:22:15.01] * Nicky tests-- out of top, 
[00:22:16.26] Nicky: Too light, 
[00:22:19.20] Kerrianne: So what do you think is happening when you add air?, 
"[00:22:29.15] Regan: This might make a big difference, one small little material ?? paper clip", 
"[00:22:36.07] Kerrianne: Nice, let's see how that works", 
[00:22:38.28] * Regan tests-- a bit low, 
"[00:22:47.22] Regan: Come on, have to get one more thing off! One more thing, and then you work. Oh I gave my balloon ??", 
[00:22:53.10] * Nicky tests, 
[00:22:55.26] Kerrianne: Did you take out air?, 
[00:22:55.26] Nicky: Yeah, 
[00:22:58.04] Kerrianne: 1-2-3-4, 
[00:23:00.14] Nicky: No! (falls to bottom), 
[00:23:18.13] * Regan tests, 
[00:23:19.26] Kerrianne: Now what'd you do? (unsure) 1-2 uh (too low), 
[00:23:24.10] Regan: I took away the mustache, 
[00:23:25.15] Kerrianne: (laughs), 
[00:23:26.26] Regan: See (shows the mustache pipe cleaner), 
[00:23:28.23] Kerrianne: Oh yeah. It's almost there, 
[00:23:31.14] Julian: Can I see if this fails?, 
[00:23:33.10] Kerrianne: Sure, 
"[00:23:35.02] Regan: You want to see if it works, not to see if it fails", 
"[00:23:38.25] Chelsea: You can see if it fails, too", 
[00:23:44.17] Julian: It already worked once [...], 
[00:23:49.09] Regan: I accidentally let the air out. Mustache...Now I'm gonna take off this ball of tin foil. There, 
[00:24:08.09] * Regan tests again-- hovers near top band, 
[00:24:13.06] Regan: Ugh. Now it's too light!, 
[00:24:16.19] Chelsea: So close, 
[00:24:23.11] * Regan adds back a piece of the foil ball he took off, 
[00:24:24.25] Nicky: I have no idea why this would work, 
[00:24:26.18] Chelsea: What's in there?, 
[00:24:28.06] * Nicky tests something-- empty balloon?-- falls to bottom, 
"[00:24:31.13] Chelsea: Well, your idea was correct it seems", 
* Nicky walks back to table without comment, 
[00:24:41.13] * Nicky blowing up balloon, 
"[00:24:41.22] Regan: K, now it will work or I will be super mad", 
[00:24:46.26] Kerrianne: What's that?, 
"[00:24:47.22] Regan: Now it will hopefully work. Took away, I took away this tin foil ball, put a little bit on, keeping a little bit", 
[00:24:57.25] Kerrianne: What was that?, 
[00:24:58.26] Regan: I took away a tin foil ball and I'm taking a little bit of it, 
"[00:25:04.04] Kerrianne: Oh, OK", 
[00:25:21.20] Nicky: Trying to put a straw in the balloon (??), 
[00:25:24.16] Kerrianne: What's that?, 
[00:25:24.27] Nicky: straw in a balloon (tests balloon--falls-starts blowing it up again), 
[00:26:18.25] * Regan watching Liam & Aeden test-- Lija asking them to come up with other ideas--it's too high, 
[00:26:18.25] Regan: maybe add a paper clip, 
[00:26:47.17] * Nicky has straw in balloon- blowing it up--not sure of his plan, 
[00:26:55.25] * Regan tests again-- just a little bit too low-- closest of all tests--, 
"[00:27:09.09] Lija: Oh, close!", 
[00:27:10.23] Regan: I keep adding, 
[00:27:13.25] Kerrianne: I think you've done the most tests of one design, 
"[00:27:16.06] Lija: So, you think adding is helping? Does it get better each time you add?", 
"[00:27:20.10] Regan: No, I keep taking away stuff", 
[00:27:22.15] Lija: OK, 
[00:27:23.14] Regan: and adding stuff, 
"[00:27:29.12] Lija: So, Regan are you gonna add more or are you taking away?", 
[00:27:32.28] Regan: I'm gonna take away a little bit, 
"[00:27:35.12] Lija: OK, so every time you take away it gets better?", 
[00:27:36.29] Regan: It gets higher, 
"[00:27:37.19] Lija: It gets higher, it hovers more?", 
"[00:27:39.01] Regan: Yes. Actually, let's try that", 
[00:27:16.22] * Nicky testing balloon with straw--goes up, 
[00:27:27.29] Nicky: ?? the little stick. This thing was supposed to come out, 
[00:27:30.21] Kerrianne: Oh you added a pipe cleaner? Oh! That's interesting. Can I see that? (balloon with straw and pipe cleaner in the end of the straw) So what you just did is you took this out and then (air, 
comes out of balloon), 
"[00:27:42.14] Nicky: Yeah, it's supposed to come out. So it can fly up and get it to float (??)", 
[00:27:46.00] Kerrianne: That's so interesting, 
[00:27:45.26] * Regan tests again-- falls below band right at 9, 
"[00:27:47.18] Kerrianne: (starts counting). Oh! Did that happen to you before too, one second?", 
"[00:28:02.05] Regan: No, it was somebody else", 
"[00:28:03.09] Kerrianne: Oh, it was", 
[00:28:06.20] Regan: Oh it's so mean. The last second, 
* [00:28:11.14] : camera falls-- Aeden puts it back, 
[00:28:25.27] * Regan tests again-- works!, 
[00:28:38.10] Kerrianne: Good job! Finally!, 
[00:28:40.13] Regan: Victory!, 
[00:28:42.23] Kerrianne: Finally, 
"[00:28:54.04] Regan: Here, this one works. This one works", 
[00:28:57.02] Nicky: ?? I'm still gonna try, 
"[00:28:58.23] Regan: Yeah, you try to make another one, and we can see if it works better", 
[00:29:04.24] * Nicky blowing up balloon, 
[00:29:40.03] Regan: I'm gonna try it again, 
[00:29:41.00] Kerrianne: Try it again? Did you add something different?, 
[00:29:42.28] Regan: No, 
[00:29:44.06] * Regan tests-- works, 
[00:29:42.28] Kerrianne: No?, 
[00:29:47.24] Kerrianne: (counting--still to 10) Nice!, 
[00:29:55.04] Regan: That's the second time that's, 
"[00:29:57.29] Lija: So, um, Regan, challenge yourself. And build a ?? design that doesn't use a balloon. Don't take that apart, cause we're gonna share at the end", 
[00:30:08.07] Regan: It keeps going like diving and then coming back up and then bouncing around, 
"[00:30:17.29] Lija: OK, challenge youself, don't take that apart, and make something that doesn't include a balloon, OK? Remember you've got the tin foil--", 
"[00:30:18.26] Nicky: I'm gonna try this. It's not gonna work, but", 
"[00:30:23.04] * Nicky testing balloon with popsicle stick--falls into fan, bad noise", 
[00:30:47.13] Nicky: OK I'm not gonna use any more loose popsicle sticks. (pause) That did not work., 
"[00:31:04.22] Regan: They have to be securely taped on. This is gonna be really random, I doubt it's gonna work, but this is my design (coffee filters on top of a piece of egg carton)", 
[00:31:14.28] Nicky: I doubt mine is gonna work, 
"[00:31:16.17] Liam: Oh that's probably not gonna work, I was using a ton of those and they always go up too high and fall down", 
"[00:31:21.29] Lija: So, engineers, you don't have to stop just make sure you're listening (big share at end, challenge to build without balloon)", 
[00:31:56.21] Kerrianne: So why do you think a cup will work?, 
[00:32:00.14] * Nicky tests empty cup, 
[00:31:58.27] Nicky: I've no idea, 
[00:32:00.03] Kerrianne: You've no idea? Well could you add something to the cup?, 
[00:32:05.01] Nicky: It needs a balloon, 
[00:32:06.18] Kerrianne: It needs a balloon? Why don't you try to do something without a balloon? This time, 
[00:32:17.04] Regan: I'm gonna try this. I bet it's gonna fail, 
[00:32:19.23] * Regan tests coffee filter & egg carton design (Kerrianne fixing testing camera?), 
[00:32:20.02] Regan: It's too high. More weight! I love more weight. more weight ??. But it's really frustrating., 
"[00:32:49.23] * Nicky doing something with coffee filters, string, pipe cleaners? & cup", 
[00:32:58.17] Nicky: Oh my god. That fit, 
[00:33:05.09] Regan: 5 popsicle sticks taped on, 
[00:33:32.21] Nicky: It's just a balloon with a bunch of random stuff, 
"[00:33:35.14] Regan: I know, but it works really well", 
[00:33:38.13] Nicky: So true, 
"[00:33:40.06] Regan: I know, it does, I'm serious", 
[00:33:43.22] * Nicky tying strings attached to cup, 
"[00:33:50.02] Regan: I finished it already, I passed it", 
[00:33:59.27] * Regan testing-- out top, 
[00:34:01.14] Kerrianne: Is everything secure?, 
[00:34:01.14] Regan: Yeah. Still too, 
[00:34:04.22] Kerrianne: Too light?, 
[00:34:05.26] Regan: yeah. This is how what I have to do a lot. More! Actually paperclips work good. Weight I love weight cause weight works, 
[00:34:43.00] * Nicky added coffee filters to strings-- goes to test, 
[00:34:56.12] Lija: Something without a balloon. So what are you expecting to happen Nicky?, 
[00:34:59.13] Nicky: It will fly up. It won't work, 
[00:35:00.26] Lija: That it will fly up? OK, 
[00:35:05.11] * Nicky tests--design flies out top, 
[00:35:03.16] * Regan tests again-- too light, 
[00:35:06.03] Lija: Are those all taped down Regan?, 
[00:35:07.15] Regan: Yeah, 
[00:35:06.01] Lija: OK cause we don't need anymore, 
[00:35:23.24] * Nicky cutting up foil balls to add?, 
"[00:35:36.24] Regan: Just a little bit more weight. Adding weight's fun, believe me. What are you trying to do?", 
[00:35:49.15] Nicky: Add weight, 
"[00:35:51.20] Regan: It's fun, you get to stick a bunch of random stuff on", 
[00:36:02.16] * Regan tests-- drops to bottom, 
[00:36:09.05] Regan: Nope. Now it's too heavy! Come on, 
[00:36:18.00] Regan: Now mine dropped to ?? (can't see what he's fixing), 
[00:36:28.00] * Regan testing again--falls (more slowly), 
[00:36:34.21] Regan: Just the piece of tape, 
[00:36:41.03] Nicky: Sadly the tape weighs stuff down, 
[00:36:49.04] * Regan tests-- falls, 
[00:36:52.09] Regan: I'm just gonna add more parachute, 
[00:36:52.27] Kerrianne: What are you changing (not sure who she's talking to). Are you trying to just take off materials?, 
"[00:36:56.25] * Nicky tests--lasts til 5, slowly falls to bottom", 
"[00:36:57.00] Kerrianne: Oh, cause last time it floated up, right?", 
[00:37:00.08] Kerrianne: (counting--to 5) halfway there, 
[00:37:07.28] Nicky: No! that's weird (??), 
* Tape 2, 
* 17:36, 
* -----------------------------------------, 
* (missing on building cameras):, 
[00:37:19.06] Nicky: I took away a tiny bit of tin foil, 
[00:37:20.17] Kerrianne: You took out a tiny bit?, 
"[00:37:22.09] Nicky: Yeah, not much", 
[00:37:28.15] * Nicky tests-- out top, 
* (not sure of time), 
* ------------------------------------------, 
[00:00:25.23] Regan: I added another parachute, 
[00:00:24.19] * Nicky tests-- counts to 5-- falls, 
[00:00:34.26] Kerrianne: So what did you do? You added a little bit of tinfoil?, 
[00:00:37.22] Nicky: Yeah, 
[00:00:37.26] Regan: I added a second parachute, 
[00:00:40.22] Kerrianne: A second one?, 
[00:00:42.22] * Regan tests-- falls, 
"[00:00:43.06] Regan: So if this one gets caught, there's still another one still", 
"[00:00:50.14] Kerrianne: A little bit better, so last time did it float up or did it", 
[00:00:54.05] Regan: It dropped automatically down, 
"[00:01:03.15] Regan: So tape this. (pause, working) try that", 
[00:01:24.09] * Nicky tests--flies out, 
[00:01:23.18] Nicky: I put a paper clip, 
[00:01:24.25] Kerrianne: A paperclip?, 
[00:01:28.07] Regan: The paperclip made it go up, 
[00:01:29.11] * Regan tests-- flies out top, 
[00:01:33.01] Regan: Too much tape (??), 
[00:01:40.05] Regan: One stick (lollipop stick). This is gonna work. I hope., 
[00:01:49.05] Regan: I had one to work but I just need this to work. I've had one to work but it took like a thousand tries and this one's taking a thousand tries too, 
[00:01:57.19] * Regan tests--flies out, 
[00:01:58.03] Regan: It's the exact same thing I have to add and take away weight all the time. More weight, 
"[00:02:01.01] Kerrianne: Yeah, I think that's the trick. Keep adding, and keep testing testing testing", 
[00:02:03.16] * Nicky tests-- falls to bottom, 
[00:02:07.14] Nicky: Added too much ??, 
[00:02:07.28] Regan: Take this away but I have to add something that's not as heavy. Hmm. Hey how about a straw (cuts a straw), 
[00:02:20.11] Nicky: I'm adding rubber bands, 
[00:02:23.09] Regan: straw and one rubber band, 
[00:02:35.21] * Nicky adding rubber bands around cup, 
[00:02:37.09] Regan: My balloon works perfectly, 
[00:02:58.09] * Regan tests--flies out before it goes in, 
[00:02:59.11] Regan: No! More weight, 
[00:03:01.18] Nicky: I added rubber bands, 
[00:03:03.09] Kerrianne: That's a good idea, 
"[00:03:04.08] * Nicky tests--top for a second, then falls", 
[00:03:05.25] Kerrianne: Uh, 
[00:03:07.23] Nicky: Ahh, 
[00:03:09.25] Kerrianne: You just can't catch a break! Keep testing, 
"[00:03:07.06] Regan: There's no tin foil oh this, so why not? (talking to himself?)", 
[00:03:15.02] * Nicky tests again-- took off rubber band--falls slowly, 
[00:03:46.05] * Nicky tests again-- falls, 
[00:03:44.24] Nicky: I just took off a rubber band, 
[00:03:47.04] Kerrianne: Took off another rubber band?, 
[00:03:50.07] Nicky: What is up with that?, 
[00:03:51.15] Kerrianne: Do you think maybe it's the cup?, 
[00:03:55.04] Nicky: It probably is. I'm gonna add another ??, 
[00:04:07.15] Nicky: I just took away a rubber band, 
[00:04:07.27] * Nicky tests again--falls slowly, 
[00:04:08.11] Kerrianne: Just took away the rubber band? 1-2, 
[00:04:12.22] Nicky: It needs another parachute, 
[00:04:14.11] Kerrianne: Yeah?, 
[00:04:17.02] Regan: Don't fly away, 
[00:04:17.05] * Regan testing--flies out, 
[00:04:19.25] Regan: More weight! I added enough weight for you thing a ma bob, 
[00:04:31.06] * Nicky cutting string, 
[00:04:50.17] Regan: That's an idea (??) where are the scissors?, 
[00:05:04.07] Nicky: There, 
"[00:05:12.00] * Regan cuts slits into coffee filters, adds another lollipop stick", 
[00:05:31.01] * Nicky adding another parachute on top of the original one, 
"[00:05:41.02] Regan: I slit, I made slits in the thing. To let some of the air out", 
* (NOTE: 42:40 on testing camera), 
"[00:05:42.26] * Regan tests-- very near top, then flies out (counts to 2 twice)", 
"[00:05:48.11] Kerrianne: I think that was a good idea though, you slit, you um, cut the coffee filters so the wind gets out?", 
[00:05:55.20] Regan: I put little slits, 
[00:06:03.24] Kerrianne: Maybe you could talk to Liam about your design, 
[00:06:07.24] Regan: Made tiny little slits. more slits, 
[00:06:08.24] * Regan tests again-- more slits -- flies out, 
[00:06:13.06] Regan: No! More slits, 
[00:06:19.10] Nicky: Another parachute. Hopefully it works!, 
"[00:06:19.29] * Nicky tests-- parachutes out of top, rest inside, then falls lower", 
[00:06:25.19] Kerrianne: I don't know if that counts with the parachute staying out, 
[00:06:36.07] Nicky: Yes! Does this count of mine cause it's staying in for a really long time, 
[00:06:46.24] Kerrianne: Are there two in there right now?, 
"[00:06:49.06] Nicky: Yeah, mine's staying in", 
"[00:06:51.11] Kerrianne: It's definitely staying in, it's staying in, it's just the placement, do you know what I mean?", 
[00:06:59.02] * Regan tests-- too low, 
[00:07:01.06] Regan: Let's see if the slits work. 1-2, 
"[00:07:03.14] Kerrianne: Oh! OK, let's make sure we do them one at a time cause it can mess it up too. Why don't you try that again, Regan?", 
[00:07:12.09] Regan: (tests again--out top) Now it's too, 
"[00:07:14.28] Kerrianne: Wait, try it, do you want to use the chair?", 
[00:07:19.23] * Regan stands on chair to test again--flies out top, 
[00:07:27.21] Regan: More slits, 
[00:07:28.11] Nicky: I made it work with no balloon!, 
[00:07:34.08] Regan: More slits, 
[00:08:20.07] Nicky: I'm gonna see if mine works again, 
[00:08:21.19] * Nicky tests again-- near top-- then falls, 
[00:08:26.20] Nicky: It works! Oh what? It used to work, 
[00:08:33.20] * Regan tests on chair--falls to bottom, 
[00:08:40.04] Regan: 1-2, 
[00:08:41.17] Kerrianne: Ugh. I know, 
[00:08:44.06] Regan: it's just really mean, 
"[00:08:48.04] Liam: Try to straighten out the top bit, so that it", 
"[00:08:51.03] Kerrianne: Yeah, want to use a chair? (to Nicky)", 
"[00:08:52.03] Nicky: Yeah, I need to use a chair", 
[00:08:55.14] Kerrianne: Do you mind if he uses the chair?, 
[00:09:03.16] * Nicky tests from chair-- high-- then very slowly sinks, 
[00:09:06.09] Liam: Oo that's actually like working. It's working, 
[00:09:12.17] Kerrianne: 1-2-3-4 (too low), 
[00:09:16.26] Nicky: It sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, 
"[00:09:20.05] Kerrianne: I know, that's kinda funny", 
[00:09:21.10] Nicky: What is up with this thing?, 
, 
"[00:10:03.16] * Regan tests again-- stays near top, then pushes it down, then it falls to bottom", 
[00:10:08.07] Regan: No!, 
[00:10:10.14] Kerrianne: I think it's getting closer, 
[00:10:16.12] * Nicky tests againgoes up, 
[00:10:18.03] Kerrianne: What did you add since last time?, 
[00:10:20.04] Nicky: Nothing, 
[00:10:20.11] Kerrianne: Nothing? You just keep testing? Maybe you need to change your design a little bit, 
"[00:10:28.20] Liam: Yeah, I think you should get those-- I'm not really sure what you're doing, I'm not really sure how to help.", 
[00:10:35.06] Nicky: I'm adding a paper clip, 
"[00:10:36.23] Liam: I think, yeah, I think weight would help", 
[00:10:43.25] * Nicky tapes on a paper clip, 
"[00:10:45.18] Regan: But I am gonna add some, I took away a lot of weight, so I am gonna add a little weight. To make sure it goes perfectly.", 
[00:10:54.23] * Nicky adds something to cup?, 
[00:11:05.22] Regan: Mine's so awesome (the balloon one) I like this one, 
[00:11:06.17] Nicky: This hopefully works. Just a little bit of weight in this, 
[00:11:09.10] * Nicky testing-- out top, 
[00:11:12.12] Kerrianne: So what did you do?, 
[00:11:14.08] Nicky: But the paper clip, 
[00:11:14.13] Kerrianne: You added a paper clip?, 
"[00:11:18.07] Nicky: Yeah, it should have got heavy. Gonna add tin foil now", 
[00:11:20.04] Kerrianne: Tin foil?, 
"[00:11:29.13] Regan: I took away a lot of weight, so I'm putting on. I took away the stick, which is a lot of weight, so I put on a paper clip. Just to balance it", 
[00:11:40.00] * Regan tests-- out top, 
[00:11:39.10] Kerrianne: Oh, 
[00:11:59.05] * Nicky tests-- out top, 
[00:12:01.09] Kerrianne: You add some tin foil?, 
[00:12:01.27] Nicky: Yeah. I added a lot. What is wrong with this? I'm adding a ton of stuff. You know what? I think I need a lot more. Where's the tin foil?, 
"[00:12:12.27] Lija: Engineers (almost 12 o'clock, 2 minutes til big share)", 
[00:13:03.23] Regan: I added a second paper clip, 
[00:13:05.07] * Regan tests--out top,

[00:14:01.27] Nicky: A quarter of a sheet,

"[00:14:16.03] Nicky: Yup, I really don't care",

[00:14:26.19] * Regan tests again-- out top, 
[00:14:28.13] Regan: No! Come on. I added a pop-- Another popsicle stick,

[00:14:38.21] Nicky: (laughing) yeah, 
[00:14:41.15] * Nicky tests--drops to bottom, 
[00:14:41.15] Kerrianne: Oh!, 
[00:14:42.25] Nicky: Now it's too heavy!? Now it's too heavy,

[00:14:48.15] Regan: Do another half sheet or something, 
"[00:14:51.17] Nicky: Nope, it's too heavy now (takes out foil ball)",

[00:15:16.04] * Nicky tests-- falls again, 
[00:15:21.26] Regan: My balloon took less tries than this, 
[00:15:26.06] Kerrianne: I know, 
[00:15:28.07] Regan: And my balloon took a long time, 
"[00:15:30.14] * Regan tests again-- count to 3, then falls", 
"[00:15:38.01] Kerrianne: I think it's sort of hovering, and then once the wind sort of tips it, you know, it's sinking, So, I'm not sure how you would fix that",

"[00:06:20.01] * Julian tests-- hovers, spins, sinks slowly", 
[00:06:23.26] Lija: Why do you think that's working? I think it's working pretty well it's a little low but., 
[00:06:24.01] Julian: it goes up and it goes down then it goes up and down., 
[00:06:30.00] Lija: But it's even spinning as well! So why is that happening you think? (design really low now), 
[00:06:38.16] Julian: I have no idea., 
[00:06:42.22] Lija: Pretty cool., 
[00:06:43.26] Julian: So it goes up and it goes down does that count as hovering?, 
"[00:06:47.06] Lija: i th-, yeah now it looks like it's caught on the side of it. But what was happening before? Why do you think it worked originally the first time?",

[00:06:59.10] Riley: How did you make those decisions?,

Riley: OK, 
Julian: And apparently it works!, 
"[00:07:18.26] Lija: So can you push your mind, push your thoughts and think why did that end up working even though you didn't plan it that way.", 
[00:07:25.19] Julian: Because sometimes it lets the air out of the vents and sometimes the air gets stuck, 
[00:07:30.21] Lija: So I think I heard you say that sometimes the air goes out and theres like vents in the paper basically just because of the way it's bent., 
[00:07:39.03] Julian: And then the vents push the bag up. (???), 
[00:07:40.21] Lija: So sometimes the vents are open and sometimes they're closed., 
"[00:07:44.03] Riley: When you're talking about the vents, which part are you talking about?", 
"[00:07:48.06] Julian: Umm, I think the holes here and there.",

[00:07:41.01] VIncenzo: How are we gonna tape this on, 
"[00:07:42.26] Marco: I know, put it like this and then give me a piece of tape", 
"[00:07:55.19] VIncenzo: Tape away, man", 
[00:07:59.16] Marco: See ???, 
--------------------------------------------------- Both testing ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:16:46.16] * M&V come to test, 
[00:16:47.15] Lija: So Vincenzo Marco what are you expecting to happen?, 
[00:16:48.19] Marco: mmmm... to it to... ahhhh (disappointed), 
"[00:16:49.00] * Marco Test, can't see, but must be too high", 
"[00:16:53.25] Lija: But you can add a little bit, yeah?", 
[00:16:49.02] Marco: So close (leave), 
"[00:08:17.23] VIncenzo: Oh wait, maybe we can put some tin foil on it", 
"[00:08:20.17] Marco: That's not gonna, that's just gonna make it hover more", 
[00:08:22.29] VIncenzo: Oh yeah, 
"[00:08:24.11] VIncenzo: There we need, add more popsicle sticks (gets more popsicle sticks)", 
[00:08:29.04] Marco: Actually this is good (the amount he has) I think this is good, 
"[00:08:31.13] VIncenzo: Yeah, make one of those walls", 
"[00:08:37.28] Marco: This looks like a patch, like a patched, like this looks like a balloon that's been through five forests", 
"[00:08:44.23] Vincenzo: I know, it looks like it's been patched", 
"[00:08:48.03] Marco: Like it's been through a forest, like a forest he chopped down a couple of trees and the trees fell on him. That's exactly what it looks like.", 
[00:08:58.20] Marco: Make patches of 3 OK? (tapes another patch on) they work good. (drops on table) OK dude I'm gonna try this, 
"[00:09:09.13] VIncenzo: Wait wait wait. One more dude, Dude, wait wait", 
"--------------------------------------------------- Both testing (Marco goes, vincenzo follows) ---------------------------------------------", 
"[00:17:50.12] * Marco comes to test, V following", 
[00:17:50.25] Marco: Hold on I just want to try this, 
[00:17:54.04] * Marco tests-- too high, 
[00:17:54.09] Marco: okay Vincenzo I think we might need more of the weight., 
[00:18:02.01] * Marco tests again--same, 
"[00:18:02.22] Marco: OK, so 2 more", 
[00:09:27.19] Vincenzo: It's working, 
[00:09:29.15] Marco: But it's coming close to ?? Can I please have some tape?, 
"[00:09:46.08] Marco: First I need to patch up this. That side better. Have to make another one, We're gonna need like 3 more. Or you could always make a patch of 5.", 
[00:10:00.12] VIncenzo: This is a 6 patch, 
[00:10:03.06] Marco: I think I'm gonna make a 6 patch too, 
"[00:10:05.17] VIncenzo: Wait dude I know what we need, hang on. Gonna tape this on, wait", 
[00:10:10.09] Marco: two 6-packs should do it, 
"[00:10:11.11] VIncenzo: Wait, just, don't put that on that, dude, don't put yours on yet", 
[00:10:18.26] Marco: We should test it, 
"[00:10:18.01] VIncenzo: Yeah, test it and if it doesn't work then put it on", 
--------------------------------------------------- Both testing ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:19:07.09] * Vincenzo tests-- slowly falls to bottom, 
[00:19:09.07] Vincenzo: one! (starting to count to 10), 
[00:19:11.26] Both: awwww, 
[00:19:12.12] Vincenzo: Too much weight, 
[00:19:14.09] Marco: Too much, 
* Riley: (takes tube off so they can get object), 
[00:19:18.12] Vincenzo: Too much, 
[00:19:22.11] Marco: I think we should change the 6 pack to a 3 pack, 
[00:10:44.18] Marco: We should just change the 6 pack into a 3 pack, 
[00:10:46.17] Vincenzo: No (pause) yeah, 
[00:10:49.07] Marco: Change the 6 pack into a 3 pack. Or we could always just take one of the 3's off. Let's just take one of the 3's off, 
[00:10:59.02] * M removes something, 
--------------------------------------------------- Both testing ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:19:41.10] * Marco tests, 
[00:19:42.04] M&V: Yes! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!, 
"[00:19:50.12] Riley: OK, I'm gonna make a guess as to why this is working.", 
"Marco: Uh, because", 
Riley: I think there was tape that was stuck on teh side of the wall (laughing) (balloon is now below band), 
"[00:20:00.25] Marco: No, but it wasn't landing on the side of the.", 
"[00:20:03.09] Vincenzo: Now it's floating back up. Aww, now it's going back down.", 
[00:20:07.19] Riley: I saw the side that was nearest me part of the tape that was on your corner down here stuck., 
"[00:20:14.18] Vincenzo: OK, let's try that again", 
"[00:20:16.19] Riley: So, but it looks like you guys are close.", 
Marco: OK (goes to put it back in), 
"Riley: You can try it again, yeah", 
"[00:20:19.21] * tests again--hovers near top, then works", 
[00:20:23.16] Vincenzo: Too light! (pushes it down) (count to 12), 
Riley: Does that count? Count!, 
"All: 1, 2, 3, ... 10, 11, 12, 13", 
[00:20:39.17] Riley: very cool., 
[00:20:41.09] Vincenzo: yeah! We did it!, 
[00:12:05.06] Marco: We finished, 
[00:12:05.27] Vincenzo: Yes! We made it!, 
[00:12:07.07] Marco: Now we can take it off ??, 
[00:12:08.21] Vincenzo: Don't take it off yet, 
[00:12:20.24] Vincenzo: Don't mess it up, 
"[00:12:30.02] Marco: Uh, we finished (to Kerrianne)", 
[00:12:32.18] Kerrianne: Yeah? Do you think you could try a different design then?, 
"[00:12:35.09] Vincenzo: Yeah, try it again, OK", 
[00:12:37.25] Chelsea: You have plenty of time, 
[00:12:38.14] Vincenzo: Let's do a different design, 
"[00:12:42.02] Marco: Dude, I've got an idea", 
"[00:12:42.29] Chelsea: Maybe something without a balloon, be super creative, lots of people are using balloons, and I know for a fact that you guys know how to make this work without a balloon 'cause I've seen it", 
[00:12:55.20] Marco: Dude I think we should just, 
"[00:12:58.01] Vincenzo: Hang on, I know how we can. Wait, how about we each try an idea?", 
* building, 
"[00:13:29.01] Riley: Woah, what are you doing here?", 
[00:13:31.00] Marco: We're making another one that does NOT include a balloon, 
[00:13:34.24] Riley: Ooo. Challenge number 2, 
[00:13:35.17] Chelsea: Since they had one that worked I challenged them to do it without a balloon, 
[00:13:39.13] Riley: Cool. Very cool., 
[00:13:44.09] Chelsea: This is very fun (the balloon one), 
[00:13:47.25] Kerrianne: I know. Did you guys, 
"[00:13:48.04] Vincenzo: Yeah, it is, we just put on more weight", 
"[00:13:50.01] Kerrianne: Nice, there you go", 
[00:13:52.07] Marco: And now it look like a balloon that went through an arts and craft room, 
"[00:13:50.24] Kerrianne: That's so funny, yeah it does.", 
[00:14:11.22] Marco: I dunno if this is gonna work or not. It's probably not gonna work, 
[00:14:15.27] Vincenzo: Test it out, 
[00:14:18.00] Riley: Test it out,

"[00:23:03.10] Marco: Yeah, that didn't ??", 
[00:23:11.09] Riley: Why did you not think it was going to work?, 
"[00:23:14.07] Marco: I dunno, it just looked like too much weight.",

"* M back, in between tests, takes off popsicle sticks",

"[00:23:34.29] * Marco back-- tests again, too light", 
[00:23:37.10] Riley: Did you change something?, 
[00:23:37.27] Marco: Uh yeah I took out two three of the popsicle sticks and now it's too light, 
[00:23:43.12] * Marco back to table for a second,

"[00:15:42.27] Marco: I know, I got another idea", 
[00:15:49.07] Lija: (clapping) So when I clap you can clap back. If you can actually free your hands. So we're noticing awesome awesome ideas and work and we're interested in knowing about what you're thinking before you test so we've, 
"got two cameras on the testing stations and we're hoping, if you feel comfortable, if you say quickly what it is that you hope to see happen, OK? And if you make a change if you can say why you", 
"made that change. And Kerrianne and Riley and Chelsea and I will kind of prompt you, so don't worry about it, we'll help you with that piece because we'd like to get at your thinking and we'd like you to", 
"be noticing your thinking as well, so see how it can help you design something.", 
"* The second thing is, we do have water here and cups and we want to make sure you're hydrating yourself, it's very dry. (...)",

[00:26:29.24] Vincenzo: It was too light., 
[00:26:31.14] Riley: And so what did you do?, 
[00:26:32.13] Vincenzo: I went in and I did another sheet of tin foil and then I added more popsicle sticks., 
[00:26:38.05] Riley: And how did you know it was too light last time?, 
[00:26:40.19] Vincenzo: Because if flew out of there.,

[00:27:44.26] Marco: Uhh..., 
[00:27:48.21] Chelsea: Do you think it matters Marco where it falls in this hoop? Do you think that if you drop it here (gesturing) or drop it there it's going to be different or that it will be the same?, 
, 
[00:27:56.15] * Marco tests again-- different place?, 
"[00:27:58.05] Marco: Uhh, I think it's going to be the same. Something weird, I don't see (pause) it (walks away)",

[00:22:20.20] Marco: Maybe lead will make it (drawing with pencil on paper), 
"[00:22:24.09] Lija: So why even this shape, Vincenzo? Is this shape helpful or important here or is it just what you came up with?", 
[00:22:30.23] VIncenzo: Just kind of what I came up with, 
[00:22:33.00] Lija: So the shape isn't important to your design?,

[00:32:26.02] Riley: It stayed up longer or shorter?, 
[00:32:28.19] Marco: It stayed up longer.,

[00:26:48.24] Chelsea: So these are a stack of coffee filters and then what are you adding to it?, 
[00:26:54.12] VIncenzo: I'm gonna try and add like wings to hover and I'm gonna add like tin foil, 
"[00:27:02.04] Chelsea: Oh, lots of stuff and it's all gonna be like flat like this?", 
[00:27:05.28] VIncenzo: mmhmm, 
"[00:27:05.19] Chelsea: Cool. And then Marco, what are you doing with that bag?", 
[00:27:09.00] Marco: I'm gonna try like putting these popsicle sticks in it and then it's gonna weigh it down because, 
[00:27:15.27] Chelsea: Which way do you do it?, 
[00:27:15.10] Marco: The bag's gonna go like this, 
[00:27:17.14] Chelsea: The open side down? Towards the fan?, 
[00:27:19.19] Marco: Yeah, 
[00:27:19.19] Chelsea: OK, 
[00:27:20.14] VIncenzo: Wait did you test it?, 
"[00:27:22.13] Marco: Yeah, I tested it without anything in and yeah, it needs some weight", 
[00:27:28.19] VIncenzo: It stunk without anything in?, 
[00:27:29.29] Marco: Yeah. It needed some weight, 
* V has popsicle sticks taped flat together with straws on sides--looks like sled, 
* [00:27:42.24] (go get water), 
* [00:28:39.03] back, 
[00:28:57.12] Marco: We already finished ours and it worked. I don't know why they chant victory., 
[00:29:11.09] Marco: Hey dude look (leaves), 
--------------------------------------------------- M testing: bag with weights ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:39:38.00] * Marco about to test paper bag, 
[00:39:38.06] Riley: Tell me about your design first., 
"[00:39:38.20] Marco: Uhh, it's a bag so it's going to catch air like this. And then the weights there are gonna make it fall", 
"* [00:39:38.20] Marco: Uhh, it's a bag so it's going to catch air like this. And then the weights there are gonna make it fall", 
[00:39:47.03] * Marco tests--flies out, 
[00:39:48.18] Riley: Does it matter which way you put the bag in?, 
"[00:39:52.05] Marco: Uh, I'll try it this way (closed bottom down)", 
[00:39:57.01] * Marco tests with bottom down--hovers above tube for a few seconds, 
"[00:40:00.24] Marco: Uhh, I think it's a little too big.", 
[00:40:03.02] Riley: OK, 
* V taking apart old one to get popsicle sticks, 
* V doing straws--taping together, 
[00:30:30.17] ************ TERRIBLE noise-- pop sticks in fan, 
* VIDEO 2 BUILDING, 
* % Wind_MV_2, 
* % building camera, 
* % 23:29 total, 
"* % last video ended with M at test, this starts with M at table", 
"[00:00:10.09] Lija: ... (middle of announcement) We'd love to see more than one way, OK? Just know that we are going to have a big share at the end so don't take your designs apart", 
[00:00:23.10] Marco: You might think I'm crazy but I think I'm gonna use this after I'm finished drinking it (goes to test), 
"* V has tin foil wings (from old design?), tapes onto new coffee filter center", 
"[00:01:04.25] * V leaves, comes back with tape", 
"[00:01:16.25] * V back, taping", 
[00:01:39.03] * V goes-- to test? (maybe on other side of table), 
--------------------------------------------------- M then V testing ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:41:37.13] Marco: I think that might work., 
[00:41:37.12] Riley: Tell me about it., 
"[00:41:38.08] Marco: Uh, I was, I just finished drinking water in it and I thought maybe this would float.", 
"[00:41:44.19] Riley: Why do you think the cup will, I love that you're trying materials that you just found around the room. why do you think that might be a good design?", 
"[00:41:53.07] Marco: Uh, because like it's gonna fall and get pushed up at the same time. Because it's, like, fallable and fly-able. It can fly and fall", 
[00:42:08.08] Riley: Why do you say it can fly and fall? What is special about the cup?, 
"[00:42:09.28] Marco: Like, if you put it (holding cup up and drops it to demonstrate) it will fall but if you put it on the wind it will go up", 
"[00:42:16.16] Riley: Okay, and why did you decide to add popsicle sticks?", 
[00:42:20.09] Marco: So it would not like go up too high., 
[00:42:24.03] Riley: Have you tested it without popsicle sticks before?, 
[00:42:26.26] Marco: No., 
"[00:42:28.25] Riley: Okay, just intuition said", 
[00:42:29.27] * Marco tests cup--falls straight to bottom, 
"[00:42:31.01] Marco: Yeah, I don't think it needs the popsicle sticks. I'm gonna try doing something else. Actually, maybe if it goes this way", 
[00:42:41.11] * Tests upside down--still falls to bottom, 
"[00:42:43.15] Marco: Yeah, Im gonna take off those", 
[00:43:09.22] Riley: Let's see. Next person. (VIncenzo there) Go for it., 
[00:43:16.17] * Vincenzo tests coffee filter & foil design--flies out top, 
[00:43:19.03] Vincenzo: Way too light., 
"[00:43:21.11] Riley: That one might be a little too big to fit inside the tube, huh?", 
[00:43:27.27] * Vincenzo checks size--holding it in top of tube, 
[00:03:08.29] * V back -- trims ends of wings, 
"[00:03:21.04] VIncenzo: Hey can we borrow some of your popsicle sticks? Nevermind, found some", 
[00:43:40.07] * Marco tests cup--drops to bottom, 
[00:43:43.21] Marco: It's gonna need some, 
[00:43:47.10] Riley: Some what?, 
[00:43:48.10] Marco: This one's gonna need a ?? (walks away), 
[00:03:35.09] Marco: I'm gonna need some air-lifting amazing tricks., 
"[00:03:43.12] Marco: Hey Bro, Can I please have some tape. Oh, were you using this?", 
* V laying out pop sticks, 
* (Can't see M), 
[00:04:30.18] VIncenzo: This is fun, 
"[00:04:31.24] Marco: I know, I'm so glad we got to ?? Aren't you hungry?", 
"[00:04:48.06] * V leaves-- but just with pop sticks, back at 5", 
--------------------------------------------------- M testing? ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:46:50.11] * Marco tests cup with foil--flies out of top, 
[00:46:51.13] Riley: What happened there?, 
"[00:46:53.12] Marco: I dunno, it just blew away. Maybe if I try putting some weight inside the cup (walks away)", 
[00:05:52.08] * V tapes more pop sticks to design, 
[00:06:15.21] * V leaves, 
[00:06:41.18] * M there-- just for a second? (can't see side of table), 
--------------------------------------------------- M then V testing ?---------------------------------------------------, 
**** Missing testing cameraso dont know if theyre testing!, 
[00:06:58.09] * V back with design-- tapes more, 
* camera cuts out? Did Vincenzo test?, 
[00:07:19.27] * V leaves again, 
--------------------------------------------------- M testing?? ---------------------------------------------------,

* V cutting foil, 
[00:09:44.03] * M back, 
[00:09:45.09] Marco: I think I'm gonna have to put more popsicle sticks, 
[00:10:13.17] Marco: Oh people are copying my cup idea, 
[00:10:16.26] Vincenzo: What cup idea?, 
* M gone-- testing?, 
* V gone-- testing?, 
* [00:10:23.27] : V testing in air?, 
--------------------------------------------------- both testing? ---------------------------------------------------, 
* [00:50:55.11] Vincenzo working on design on chair near camera, 
* [00:51:26.13] V gets up to test, 
* V testing I think, 
* TEST CAMERA 2 (these times for test camera 1from SCR camera), 
[00:51:49.03] Riley: Wanna test it again?, 
"[00:51:49.25] Marco: Yeah, I think I'll go try it again. Like this", 
[00:51:57.25] Riley: What do you see happening?, 
"[00:51:59.17] Marco: It's um, well actually I'm gonna try to ??", 
***** test camera 2, 
[00:00:00.29] Marco: Wooo, 
[00:00:01.02] * M tests-- foil-cup thing, 
[00:00:03.14] Riley: So what do you see happening?, 
[00:00:05.14] Marco: It's got ??? Actually I'm gonna try to, 
* (camera cuts out), 
[00:12:17.01] * something flung on table-- M back?, 
[00:52:34.02] Riley: OK Vincenzo, 
* V tests, 
"[00:52:41.25] Riley: one, two, three. ?? Let's test it again.",

"[00:12:54.23] Vincenzo: Huh, this isn't taped down. Um", 
* V taping more of design, 
* decent pictures, 
* V taping more foil to other side,

* [0 on test 3 = 14:00 on build 2], 
[00:54:13.12] Riley: So what'd you change?, 
[00:54:14.01] Marco: What?, 
[00:54:14.09] Riley: What did you change?, 
[00:54:15.26] Marco: I ??, 
[00:00:00.00] * Marco testing something with foil-- falls, 
[00:00:02.05] Marco: Oh! That makes sense., 
[00:00:05.10] Riley: Why does it make sense now?, 
[00:00:07.07] Marco: Now I know that it was them that was (takes out popsicle sticks from design) ?? that was making it fall., 
[00:00:10.20] * Marco tests again (with pop sticks removed), 
[00:00:12.06] Riley: It was what?, 
[00:00:14.08] Marco: it was these (popsicle sticks) but I guess it was the whole thing., 
* [00:14:23.24] Marco back, 
[00:14:24.12] Vincenzo: Did it work?, 
[00:14:27.29] Marco: Can I use this? (V's drinking cup), 
[00:14:30.03] Vincenzo: Sure., 
[00:14:32.16] * V leaves to test, 
--------------------------------------------------- V testing ---------------------------------------------------, 
"* [00:00:35.22] V testing in air-- falls, throws up in air 3 times and it falls each time, then goes to testing station", 
* M taping cups together, 
[00:15:37.06] * M leaves, 
* (MV talking to side--hard to hear), 
[00:01:59.09] Marco: Woah dude that thing's heavier than mine, 
* testing to side, 
"[00:02:05.06] Vincenzo: Mine's slower, it went down slower", 
[00:02:14.26] Marco: This is way heavier. Don't you think this is heavier?, 
--------------------------------------------------- both testing ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:17:17.21] Riley: OK Vincenzo, 
* V testing big flat foil covered thing, 
"[00:03:18.20] Riley: Okay Vincenzo, what did you change about your design?", 
"[00:03:22.17] Vincenzo: Umm, I just added more tin foil because it too heavy.", 
[00:03:27.19] Riley: Because it was too heavy and so now you added tin foil, 
[00:03:31.03] Vincenzo: Yeah, 
"[00:03:31.14] * V tests-- hovers for < a second, then falls", 
[00:03:31.10] Riley: and the tin foil makes it lighter? Is that what you're saying? So what about the tin foil makes it lighter?, 
"[00:03:38.11] Vincenzo: Well, umm... (holding design and looking at it)", 
[00:03:41.29] Riley: Tell me about it., 
"[00:03:43.22] Vincenzo: Umm, (shrugs) I dunno.", 
"[00:03:47.01] Riley: So, last time it sunk down right? And you are saying it was too heavy and that's why it sunk to the bottom.", 
[00:03:53.16] Vincenzo: Yeah., 
[00:03:54.20] Riley: So you went back to your table and you grabbed some tin foil to add to it and what's that tin foil going to do?, 
"[00:03:59.13] Vincenzo: Well, I think that since tin foil is light it sometimes helps it float so I (fades away)", 
"[00:04:07.24] Riley: Okay, cool, so what do you think, (sees V holding it up to test again) you can test it again.", 
"[00:04:12.22] * V tests again-- falls, hitting sides on way down (kinda big)", 
[00:04:18.26] Riley: So...what are you going to do when you get back to your table? What are you thinking right now? Vincenzo, 
[00:04:25.12] Vincenzo: I'm thinking of ways I can make it lighter., 
[00:04:28.24] Riley: Ways you can make it lighter okay., 
"[00:18:30.23] Lija: Engineers, can I have everyone stop and freeze for a moment? It is almost 12 O'clock. So we have been having so much fun that I even lost track of time, so I want to get where your", 
"heads are and how you feel, OK? Are you ready to stop and have some lunch? Or are you feeling like a few more minutes of this adn then we'll do a quick big share? Um, well I'm not so", 
"hungry are you guys ready for lunch? (Yeah) So then this is what I propose I propose we all stop in like 2 minutes, do one last thing, we'll have a big share out get some kudos and and some", 
suggestions/compliments and then we'll have a super fast clean up and then have lunch. Sound good? (Yup). Literally 2 minutes. 2 minutes I'm calling time and then we can have a big share. OK?, 
"[00:18:33.09] * V walks past table, then back to table", 
"*V adding straws, more foil?", 
"* Marco there with two cups together, rubber band holding them, holding design inside tube, fan is off", 
[00:05:35.00] Riley: Wait for it to get up to speed., 
[00:05:42.23] Marco: Now is it good?, 
"[00:05:43.21] Riley: Okay, you can do it now.", 
[00:05:47.28] * M tests-- drops straight to bottom, 
[00:05:49.08] Riley: So why do you think it sunk to the bottom? What did you do to you design it's very different from last time?, 
[00:05:53.01] Marco: I was going to try and do something a little different., 
[00:05:57.07] Riley: How did you decide to do that?, 
[00:05:59.04] Marco: I don't know it just came to me., 
[00:06:01.19] * M tests again-- again drops, 
[00:06:02.18] Sophia: That was slower than like usually..., 
[00:06:05.04] Lija: It was a little bit slower that time?, 
"[00:20:17.28] * M back, taping (off screen mostly)", 
* V taping more straws, 
* M playing with balloon design, 
[00:21:32.03] Marco: This is actually pretty heavy (successful balloon design), 
[00:21:47.22] Vincenzo: I cannot fail, 
"[00:22:04.28] Lija: OK, alright so time. Choose the one thing that you want to show off to the group, cause some of you have more than one design", 
--------------------------------------------------- both testing ---------------------------------------------------, 
[00:08:28.04] Riley: Wanna do a last one?, 
"[00:08:33.27] * V tests-- hovers longer than usual, then falls", 
[00:08:35.21] Riley: So what did you do?, 
[00:08:37.19] Vincenzo: I added more tin foil., 
[00:08:39.11] Riley: So you added more tin foil. So what does that do?, 
[00:08:40.11] Vincenzo: And straws., 
[00:08:42.12] Riley: What do the tin foil and straws do?, 
"[00:08:44.24] Vincenzo: Umm, I just kind of wanted it to float.", 
[00:08:48.15] Riley: And you're saying those help it float?, 
"[00:08:50.18] Vincenzo: Like, the tin foil I wanted to float, so like I put the tin foil on to get it to float but then I thought it might be too light so I added straws.", 
[00:09:02.24] Riley: The straws make it heavier and the tin foil is making it lighter to help it float?, 
[00:09:11.05] * Marco tests-- again drops to bottom, 
------------------ final test --------------------, 
"[00:58:33.21] Marco: Yeah, uh we made a balloon", 
[00:58:37.13] Vincenzo: We made, 
[00:58:44.24] Vincenzo: Like we made this base so we just kept adding ??, 
[00:58:52.13] Adult: So you tried it without these and then you just kept adding on and taking away,
